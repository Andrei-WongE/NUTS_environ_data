# Introduction:

# Workflow:

Using the NUTS package we can:

-   nuts_classify() detects the NUTS version(s) and level(s) of a data set. Its output can be directly fed into the two other functions.

-   nuts_convert_version() converts your data to a desired NUTS version (2006, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2021). This transformation works in any direction.

-   nuts_aggregate() aggregates data to some upper-level NUTS code, i.e., it transforms NUTS-3 data to the NUTS-2 or NUTS-1 level (but not vice versa).

# Obtaining data

GHS (2023) 
Epochs: c(1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030)
Resolution: 1km
Coordinate System: Mollweide

The combined information result into a new layer (resolution 1Km) which disergards administrative boundaries, and represents the presence and density of population.
In the GHS pop grid, the grid cell value represents the absolute number of inhabitants.

Advantages of population grids, from https://academy.europa.eu/pluginfile.php/17898/mod_scorm/intro/mod4-large.mp4?time=1656319630211 
Do not depend on the shape and size of census units
Do not depend on the boundary of census units
Grid cells have the same size and are stable over time
Grids integrate easily with other data
Grid cells can be assembled into custom zones

ERAS5 ()


NUTS1&2 (2016)


```{r}

```

# Data cleaning and wrangling

The spatial analysis operations to perform are:
- Aggregation: change of scale of the information, from 1km GHS population grid to 25km ERAS5 grid/cmip6-x0.25 grid. This means the reprojection of population grids maintaining volumes and minimising displacement of population.

- Zonal statistics:Summary of rasters by zones, at the NUTS1&2 regions.

_ Warping:  Changing the coordinate system of grids storing population counts is typically a challenging task, due to the need to keep the population totals unchanged (i.e. volume preservation). One critical aspect of population grids is that they represent a given spatial distribution and volume of people (i.e. total number of persons) for the area being represented. This volume (e.g. the population of a country in a given year) should not suffer significant changes when converting such a grid from the coordinate system in which it is produced to another coordinate system. From: ghs-popwarp_user_guide_online.pdf

Currently the number of population grid products with large territorial coverage is increasing, but each of the
products has different assumptions, technical specifications (Leyk et al. 2019) and therefore different fitness
for use. Population grids differ in population concepts, methods for production, spatial and temporal
resolution, temporal coverage, distribution policy and also spatial reference (coordinate system).

Operation: GHS 1km grid using Mollewiede projection to ERAS5 25km grid using WGS84 projection.

# Dataset building

##  era5-x0.25_A:
ERA5 data is provided at 0.25 x 0.25-degree resolution globally. This indicates it uses a regular latitude/longitude grid (WGS84/EPSG:4326).

Panel with waves 2010-2022 for each NUTS1/NUTS2 region. 
Use population weights to aggregate the climate grisdcell level data.
The population data comes from GHS data using as base the years of 2010,2015 and 2020.

Population-weighted varaible is produced by multiplying the value of the varaiable in a given cell with the population in the same cell, summing over the area, and the dividing by the total population in that area.

The API query function was parametrized with the following values:

First we use NUTS1&2 extent to clip ERA5 model extent.
Secondly we use the population grid to aggregate the climate data to NUTS1&2 level.
This gives area-weighted values that account for the changing grid cell size with latitude. It's particularly important for large NUTS regions that span multiple latitudes.
